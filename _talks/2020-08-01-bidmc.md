excerpt: "Mental health disorders affect a large population worldwide, yet the resources for online help remain scarce. In a collaboration with clinicians at the Beth Israel Deaconess medical center, I am exploring methods to predict relapse episodes in patients with Schizophrenia through data collected via a smartphone app called mindLAMP.
